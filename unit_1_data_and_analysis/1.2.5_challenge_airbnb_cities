# What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?
SQL Code:
First, run this to get rid of dollar sign in price columns
UPDATE
	listings
SET
	price = REPLACE(price, '$', '')
	weekly_price = REPLACE(weekly_price, '$', '')
	monthly_price = REPLACE(monthly_price, '$', '')
UPDATE
	calendar
SET
	price = REPLACE(price, '$', '')
	available = REPLACE(available, 'f', '0')
	available = REPLACE(available, 't', '1')

Then, run this to get most expensive listings
SELECT
	price,
	weekly_price,
	monthly_price,
	host_name
FROM
	listings
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 5

Return from DB Browser:
5 rows returned in 81ms
The most expensive Airbnb for a single night is 9,996.00! Weekly it is 9,999.00 and monthly it is 9,999.00. Most surprisingly, these expensive Airbnbs have a similarly expensive single night, weekly or monthly price.

# What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?
SQL Code:
SELECT
	neighborhood,
	COUNT(neighborhood) n_count
FROM
	listings
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY n_count DESC
LIMIT 5

Return from DB Browser:
5 rows returned in 79ms
The Mission District with 1063 listings. Surprisingly, the next highest is Western Addition/NOPA with 543 listings.
If I change the column to neighborhood_cleansed, the values of Mission and Western Addition change to 1038 and 810, respectively.

# What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? What about the busiest?
SQL Code:
-- Absolute Lowest Price
SELECT
	date,
	price
FROM
	calendar
WHERE price != 0
ORDER BY price

-- Lowest Average Price
SELECT
	date,
	AVG(price) as avg_price
FROM
	calendar
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY avg_price

-- Most/Least available Date in calendar table
SELECT
	date,
	SUM(available) as total_available
FROM
	calendar
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY total_available

Return from DB Browser:
By cheapest, we may mean absolute lowest price or lowest average price.
