# Let's confirm some of this new knowledge with a few basic exercises. Write SQL queries to return:

# The ID's and durations for all trips of duration greater than 500, ordered by duration.
SQL Code:
SELECT
	trip_id,
	duration
FROM
	trips
WHERE
	duration > 500
ORDER BY duration

Return in DB Browser:
165545 rows returned in 545ms

# Every column of the stations table for station id 84.
SQL Code:
SELECT
	*
FROM
	stations
WHERE
	station_id = 84

Return in DB Browser:
1 rows returned in 58ms

# The min temperatures of all the occurrences of rain in zip 94301.
SQL Code:
SELECT
	MinTemperatureF,
	ZIP
FROM
	weather
WHERE
	ZIP = 94301

Return in DB Browser:
366 rows returned in 42ms
